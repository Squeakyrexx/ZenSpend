## Style Guidelines:

- Background color: Dark charcoal (#333333) to create a calm, premium feel. The darkness gives prominence to other UI elements and reduces eye strain.
- Primary color: Soft gradient of muted lavender (#C4A4D9) to evoke feelings of balance and peace without being loud.
- Accent color: Light silver (#D0D0D0) for highlights, buttons, and interactive elements to bring visual contrast and focus.
- Font: 'SF Pro Rounded' (sans-serif) for body and headlines; its rounded terminals will enhance readability and smoothness in accordance with the app's design goals. Note: currently only Google Fonts are supported.
- Use simple, thin line icons from Lucide to maintain a clean and modern aesthetic. Icons should subtly represent each category.
- Employ generous padding and rounded corners (20px+) to create a comfortable and intuitive user interface. Maximize content spacing.
- Implement soft fade-in and bounce animations for smooth transitions and feedback, avoiding harsh or jarring effects.
